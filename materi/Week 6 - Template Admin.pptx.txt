Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

We will discuss how to use Custom HTML from a UI/UX designer into your Laravel Framework.
We use Blade Template (https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/blade#introduction)
Commonly used Template Syntax:
@section @endsection
@yield
@extends
{{ ….. }}  -> displaying Data
{!! …….. !!}} -> Displaying Unescaped Data
@json (json encode to render json data)
Templating
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Templates, which embedded in the Laravel Framework, have various types according to their functions.
There are 2 types of templates: Administrative Templates (backend) and Public Templates (front-end).
The backend is part of the portal that is used for the administration of all data and is accessed by the company's internals. Usually has a simple UI/UX but displays complete and detailed data.
The front end is the part of the portal that is used to publish information to public. The main challenge is how to manage interactions with general users. Public Side has an attractive UI/UX and accommodated various kinds of interactions
The technique of installing templates both Front-end and Backend has the same method.

Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Search & download HTML templates
Extract the HTML template source code
Choose and Recognize Layouts that are used as the basic UI framework
Slicing Layout to determine which is the parent (base layout) and child blade
Apply Layouts and Child Templates in Laravel's Resources View
Customize child templates with existing templates
Integrate child templates with layout templates with @yield and @extends syntax
Integrate template assets in Laravel project path with @asset . syntax
Steps

1. Find your Template
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
You can get custom Template from any resources like: themeforest, templatemonster, and so on.
For this lesson, we already provided 1 template for you.

We use: AdminLTE


Copy and extract this zip 
In AdminLTE, our layout is located on dist/pages.
Copy your element & assets template into directory public. In this case: assets, css and js inside dist directory
2. Extract source HTML 
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya


Open your template and we analyze our `main` template. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Extract source HTML (2)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

3. Identify your Layout
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Use the Inspect Element help tool in each browser.
The header in AdminLTE is found as follows
The syntax or class declaring header is
	
<nav class="app-header navbar navbar-expand bg-body">
Layout Analysis: Headers
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Use [Pick inspector] (Ctrl+Shift+C) at Firefox

Use the Inspect Element help tool in each browser.
Sidebar on AdminLTE
The syntax or class declaring it left-menu is a
<aside class="app-sidebar bg-body-secondary shadow" data-bs-theme="dark">
Layout Analysis: Sidebar
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Use the Inspect Element help tool in each browser.
The Content on AdminLTE was found as follows
The syntax or class that declares content is …
 <main class="app-main">
Layout Analysis: Content
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

The AdminLTE Admin template has 3 parts, namely
Header 
Sidebar
Content
When choosing a different menu, only the content section always show different content based on the selected menu.
When selecting a different menu, the 'sidebar' section has minor change in content. Only different CSS for the active menu
When choosing a different menu, the 'header' section has minor change

Hence, the ‘content' part must be sliced from the main layout
3. Identify Layout (Summary)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Based on the previous work steps, we can define:
Child Layout is the program snippet from the inside ‘content’
Base Layout is the entire HTML code of the 'index.html' file except ‘content’ section
4. Define Base Layout and Child Layout
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Child Layout
Base Layout

Create a folder called 'layouts' in resources/views
5. Apply Layouts and Child Templates on Laravel Resources View (1)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Create a new blade file. (extension: *.blade.php)

Filenames are basically free, but are recommended according to the `theme name`
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
5. Apply Layouts and Child Templates on Laravel Resources View (2)

Copy all the HTML scripts in index.html and paste them into layouts `adminlte4.blade.php`

(see next slide) Move the `content` section and move script html into `child layout` (see next slide)

5. Apply Layouts and Child Templates on Laravel Resources View (3)

5. Apply Layouts and Child Templates on Laravel Resources View (4)
Collapse <main class> ‘page-content’ and remove
“….”. Because we substitute with @yield

In the main-layout file, named `adminlte4.blade.php`, please add @yield('content’) near the red boxed (previous slide) to indicate that the section will be filled with a child. 

In the beginning of child-layout file, programmer must create @section syntax to synchronize the child & main layout.

Inside the section of `child-layout` please paste the script content inside the red-boxed (from the previous slide) and modify the page title to make it more appropriate
6. Integrate child layout with our `main template` using @yield, @section and @extends syntax
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Cut (Ctrl+X)
From your template, cut your content data
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
New Child File 
(ex: index2.blade.php)

Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
@extends('layouts.adminlte4’)

@section('content')
<!--begin::App Content Header-->
        <div class="app-content-header">
         …..
       </div>
@endsection
In adminlte4.blade.php

Practice #2: Implement the Template in Index of Food View
25
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Add @extends and @section
Also take the page-title and page-bar and modify it to fit the contents of the page

Expected Results :
Adapt your Food/index.blade.php into your Template
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Remove non-essential content
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Extend the parent/base layout and add a section for the content.

Put your content script data inside the section(‘content’)

Apply Layouts and Child Templates in Laravel's Resources View
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Don’t forget to check your `main-layout` and `child-layout` has similar name
Integrate child templates with layout templates with @yield and @extends syntax
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

In the child-layout file (eg: food/index.blade.php), it is written @extends and @section.
 
@extends has a layout name parameter that is used as a benchmark.
@extends is placed on top of the same as import in the controller file.

@section has a yield name parameter to be entered.
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Integrate child templates with layout templates with @yield and @extends syntax (2)

Add @section ('content') on the 3rd line (above the container-fluid class div because it indicates that from line 4 to @endsection will be pasted on @yield('content') in layouts.

Integrate child templates with layout templates with @yield and @extends syntax (3)
. . .

Result
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Your template isn’t load correctly. Please check your “Inspect Element” and “Network tab”.

This case caused by your asset template is missing.

The components of template are
Asset css
Asset js
Asset img



What’s wrong?
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

The solution is type “asset()” function before and after `all import js/css/image` scripts in layouts template.

Usually import js/css scripts are located at the beginning (header) of html and footer of html
SOLUTION: Install Asset JS/CSS template with @asset syntax

Practice #3: Updating the menu for links to other tables
36
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Go to the script file that implements left-menu
Determine what links will appear in the menu
Find the URI from the menu in web.php or use the artisan syntax “php artisan route:list”
Use the syntax @route('route_name') or @url('path_url') where it goes
Workflow Development
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

In the above case we go to layouts/adminlte4.blade.php on the <div class="sidebar-wrapper">
1. Go to the script file that implements left-menu
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Modify the coding in this case by providing 2 menus, namely: Food, Category menus
In addition to the menu above, we will delete it.
2. Determine what links will appear in the menu
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

With php artisan route:list we are helped to find the link url or route name of the action to be displayed
3. Find your URI from route:list
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Remember @route and
@url is syntax
blade then must
given {{ … }}
Add script -> route()
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Result
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya


#1. Modify all page of views and reports that you have created in previous tasks with new templates.  
Food/Category/Customer/Order
All your Report
#2. Add menus in the sidebar to access those pages.
#3. Change each of title homepage with your current page (clue: add @yield(‘title’) at your layouts)
#4. Change active menu from your side-bar menu. (clue: add @yield(‘side-bar’) at your layouts and add “active” in side class)
