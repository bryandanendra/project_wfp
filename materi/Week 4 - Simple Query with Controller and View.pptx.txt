There are 3 variants of query syntax to manage data from the database, namely:
Raw Queries
Query Builder
Eloquent ORM
All techniques will generate queries based on DBMS language (as shown in the image)
Query Communication
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Raw Query is a method that that EXPLICITLY uses "native” SQL to manage data from a DBMS.
(Advantages) Raw Query is easier to use if we are already familiar with queries in the Native SQL.
(Disadvantages for long-term development) If you need to migrate your schema into another DBMS (i.e : from MySQL to PostgreSQL), then you need to adjust each query so it can run in the new DBMS.
Source : https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries#raw-expressions 

Example : There are 2 tables: foods and categories. The query to display the all foods and its category is presented below:

Raw Queries
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Query Builder is a query method provided by Laravel that uses PHP language to access the database.
With this method, Laravel will automatically adjusts query into a raw format (native SQL form) that matches the target DBMS .
The advantage is, if our project utilizes multiple DBMS, then we don’t need to re-adjust the query. Query Builder will automatically adjust it for us. 

Example : There are 2 tables: foods and categories. The query to display the all foods and its category is presented below:

Eloquent ORM
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Lots of Query Syntax can be found in the Controller file or Model file to manage data requested by User.

User requests are processed by Laravel application in the Routing File and then directed to a specific Controller file.
Where is Query syntax used?

Controllers
8
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Controllers in Laravel are PHP files located in the App/Http/Controllers directory.
The controller contains PHP script with Object Oriented structure.
The Controller class name will be the same as the File name of the controller. Please note that “all names are case sensitive”.
Usually, controller receives requests from users and then handle it by performing some logic statements. The output will be returned as responses for a specific view.
We can access database from a Controller by using either Query Builder or Eloquent ORM.
Controllers
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Controllers and Routing work together to handle requests.
Routing manages HTTP commands, URLs and map in the Routing table to direct data handling.
The results of the instructions from Routing will be the initial data for a function on a particular controller. In general, the initial data is a parameter.
Controller Relationship with Routing
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Instruction from Routing

Generally, the controller handles data display and data manipulation.
Data display: displaying all the data in the database, displaying certain data in accordance with criteria
Data manipulation: adding, editing and deleting data.
The above functions are usually called CRUD functions (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete)
Contents of The Controller
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Laravel gives convenient syntaxes to help developers create "CRUD" on the controller with one single line of code.
To use it, we can use the following Artisan command:




When using resources, you only need to create one method in routing files (web.php)





That single method will manage CRUD in the Photo table (on case above) .

Source : https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/controllers#resource-controllers 
Resource Controller 
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

To manage CRUD, we must follow the existing Action Handler rules determined by Laravel Resource Controller.
Resource Controller
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

If your routing file contains




Then your website will get the following routes : 
GET method with url BASE_URL/photos redirects to PhotoController index() function and named as ' photos.index '
GET method with url BASE_URL/photos/create redirected to PhotoController create() function and named as ' photos.create '
POST method with url BASE_URL/photos redirects to PhotoController store() function and named as ' photos.store '
……. ( etc until )
DELETE method with url BASE_URL/photos/{photo} redirected to PhotoController destroy() function and named as ' photos.destroy '

NB: /photos/{photo} will contain the ID of {photo} photo to be deleted
Example : if we want to delete photo id=1, then url must be BASE_URL/photos/1 with the HTTP DELETE method
Resource Controller Explanation
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

(20 minutes)

Create 2 controllers in your 2 tables, namely: `FoodController` and `CategoryController`
Name those controllers with a singular name
Use additional parameter “--resource”

Try: if you create a controller without --resources, 
what happens to the contents of the  controller file? Discuss in class !

PRACTICE #1
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

The implementation of HTTP methods usually done in a View (basically is a HTML form)
The GET method is the default HTTP method used when we access the browser. GET Method transferred data parameters between open URLs, those parameters could be seen on the URL.
The POST method is the HTTP method used to secure the transferred data from seen on the URL. To change the method, just like on Web Programming course, we need to change the method on the form element into “POST”.
Changing the HTTP Method
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
……….

For methods other than GET and POST, you have to do "HTTP method spoofing" based on https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/controllers#resource-controllers in Spoofing Form Methods subchapter ( https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/routing#form-method-spoofing )
The following example shows a Form Method Spoofing for the PUT method. Fill the form method with “POST” and include “@method('PUT’)” blade syntax

Eloquent ORM is model class in the Laravel Framework. To make it easier, next we will use "model" terminology for this.

The Laravel model is in the app folder
There are 2 ways to make a Laravel model:
Make the model directly.
Artisan Syntax:
php artisan make:model ModelName

Because the models are related tightly with the controller, we can create model and controller simultaneously in a single syntax:
Artisan Syntax:
php artisan make:controller ControllerName --resource -model= ModelName

Getting to know Eloquent ORM
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Model Class Structure consists of:
Table Name
Timestamps for created_at and updated_at status
Primary Key column name
Primary Key Column Type
(source : https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent#eloquent-model-conventions)

Eloquent Function that define relation with other tables (either one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
(source : https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/eloquent-relationships#introduction)
Filling in the Model 
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Table Name
Model name is singular, but database name is plural. Example: if the model is named Product, then the table name in the database is products. If the database name is not following the Laravel's naming convention, then we can override the configuration later.

Primary Key
The primary key column default name is 'id'. Primary Key default type is Unsigned Big Integer and has AUTO_INCREMENT element. If we use different name and type for the primary key, we can also override it in the Model class.

Timestamps
By default all tables in the Laravel framework have created_at and updated_at columns. We can implement it in migrations by using timestamps(). If we used pre-designed schema (i.e : ERD from MySQL Workbench), then we need to re-adjust it later by overriding the configuration..


More in about Models
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

From the example image, we can identify that the database structures of “Soal” model is :
Table name: ’soal’
Primary Key(PK) column: ’soal_id '
Primary Key(PK) not using auto_increment 
Primary Key(PK) type is varchar/string
“Soal” table has timestamps, timestamps column’s name is not ‘created_at’ & ‘updated_at’ but rather ‘creation_date’ and ‘last_update’
Overriding Model Defaults

Implementing RELATION on Eloquent.

Relation isn’t automatically creating by system. Programmer have to define inside Model Eloquent so we can perform queries with ORM
The definition is only necessary once at the beginning when a new FK is installed
Relationships in ORM

You can integrate the Controller with a specific Model by using parameter --model= ModelName when creating the controller.
Controller with Models
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

When performing a query with the DB class (namely: RAW and Query Builder), use import DB with the image syntax below.
     (same as OOP concept ) Place it above the class definition
Notes

2. When performing a query with ELOQUENT QUERY, don't forget to use Import on each Class Models.
(same as OOP concept ) Place it above the class definition

Notes
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

You can see the installed routing (either manually or with the route list)




Viewing Route List Syntax
php artisan route:list
Route List Additional Notes

View
32
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

View is a file with extension “.php” and containing html script, css, jquery, and php. In Laravel, it is known as blade template file.
Location of View: resources/views folder
View File Extension:
When we want to use blade syntax then name it “<file_name>.blade.php ”
When we don’t use blade syntax then name it “<filename>.php”
View

Practice #3: Create a Controller to display all your Product Food data
34
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Use Artisan Command to create a Controller and its model. Model name is singular of table name in the database.

php artisan make:controller FoodController --resource --model=Food


Fill the index() in the Controller file with a command to retrieve all data in the ticket table. The index() function is selected because index is usually used to display list of data.
Steps

Kelebihan collection Laravel: Collections - Laravel 10.x - The PHP Framework For Web Artisans 

Kelebihan menggunakan Collections laravel adalah kita bisa memanipulasi data (order, sorting, filter) secara PHP dengan sintaksis lebih simple.

Sebagai contoh: terdapat data makanan dan mau diurutkan dari harga (“price”), maka di Query tidak perlu order, tetapi di PHP Collections kita order 

When an error appears like image below





So, you need to import the DB in that class (see Notes)
Remember, all static classes that are called must be imported before being executed.

Its characteristic is classname :: function (); 
This means that in the import there must be “use package\classname”

3. Passing the data to a specific view. 
Naming pattern is ‘foldername.viewfilename ‘. (i.e : ‘foods.index’ means that we are passing the data into ‘index.blade.php’ that is located in folder ‘resource/view/foods’)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

In the example above, we should create the view in:
/resources/views/foods/index.blade.php
Create call View and create a View
