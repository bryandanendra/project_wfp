Every Query technique, whether Query Builder or Eloquent Model,  can accommodate various SQL syntaxes for data filtering, data aggregation, joining between data, data grouping, and data sorting

select * from users where name=‚Äòandi‚Äô and password=‚Äòandi‚Äô ü°∫ Filter
select count(*) from users where name LIKE ‚Äò%andi%‚Äô ü°∫ Agregation & Filter
select places.name, count(places.id) from places left join types on types.id = places.id group by places.id order by places.id desc ü°∫ Agregation, Join, Group & Sort Data

Raw Queries
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Select * from users where status = 1 AND subscribed <> 1
Example of Filter Data

https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries#where-clauses 

Example of Data Group / Limit Data
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries#grouping 

Example of Data Aggregation
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries#aggregates 
Select count(*) from users;

Select max(price) from orders;
Select avg(price) from orders
    where finalized = 1; 

Aggregation with Eloquent Model
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries#aggregates 

Example of Joining Data
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queries#joins 
select users.*, contacts.phone, orders.price
 from users
 inner join contacts on users.id=contacts.user_id
 inner join orders on users.id = orders.user_id
select *
   from users
   left join posts on users.id=posts_user_id
select *
   from users
   right join posts on users.id=posts_user_id

Example of Sorting Data
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
select *
   from users
   order by name DESC

Query with Eloquent Model
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
When using Eloquent ORM(Model), Laravel provides various kinds of helpers or functions that are used. The syntax is similar to QueryBuilder.



Select *
   from flights
   where active = 1
   order by name DESC
    LIMIT 10;



Eloquent : Retrieve Only Single Records
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Query with Raw Statement
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
The concept of Query using RAW method either with DB or Model has an identical way, namely with the select syntax. Inside the select, there is a string that contains the query. 

You can use Prepared Statement concept in PHP (similar like in C# or Java)

Prepared Statement
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
This syntax is similar to ‚Äúselect * from active users = 1‚Äù
but stated in more secure form of query, prepared statements also check data types which can help prevent SQL injection attacks.

Sub-Query
14
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Prepared Statement
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Remember about Sub-Query Syntax ?

There are 3 types of Sub-Query : 
‚Äòselect clause‚Äô,
‚Äòfrom clause‚Äô 
‚Äòwhere clause‚Äô

SubQuery: Select Clause
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Sample Case : 

show all Supplier ID and Name, number of stock that is already supplied and show the average number of stock from all supplier

Another Solution with DB::raw()
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

SubQuery: From Clause
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Sample Case : 

Show all User Data and the user‚Äôs latest post from each user that already published

Query Builder: From Clause
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
$latestPosts is a query statement to the latest post for each user.

SubQuery: Where Clause with DB Table()
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Sample Case : 

show id, the full name of employee, and salary of the employee that has a salary above the average of all salaries in this company

SubQuery: Where Clause with Eloquent
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Sample Case : 

show id, the full name of employee, and salary of the employee that has a salary above the average of all salaries in this company

Eloquent RelationshipCase : Post and Comment
22
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Eloquent Relationship
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
One of the benefits of using the Eloquent Model is the simplification of your Query statements. 

To realize the benefit, the developer must assign the `relationship` in the early stage of development (after the creation of the model or after changes to the table structure).

There are 2 types of basic relationship:
One-to-many (similar with many-to-one in implementation phase)
Many-to-Many

This implementation is inside of each Model Class.

Note: 
You should create a ModelClass first with 
Example: php artisan make:model Product

One to Many : hasMany
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
One-to-many

There are 2 syntaxes:
`hasMany` keyword 
`belongsTo` keyword 

If you have a custom name of Identifier (ID/Primary Key) or Foreign Key(FK) columns, You may also override the foreign and local keys by passing additional arguments to the hasMany.

As an example below, the `kota`, `penjual` table, and `id_kota` column isn‚Äôt a standard name of Laravel Eloquent Model. We should define it in the following way(use overriding if necessary).


Inside the Kota Class

Class Kota extends Model {
   protected $table = ‚Äòkota‚Äô;
 
   public function penjuals() {
     return $this->hasMany(Penjual::class, ‚Äòid_kota‚Äô, ‚Äòid‚Äô);
   }

}
Pay attention to the position of the columns (red and green), don't get them mixed up !

One to Many : hasMany (2)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
The usage of Eloquent‚Äôs `hasMany` statement is the same as the picture above.

This syntax can implement inside the Controller.
Define or import ModelClass first
Call your Model and call the function without a bracket ()
$comments will assign with list of Comment based on Post that has id=1

Example : `hasMany` keyword 

One to Many : belongsTo
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
One-to-many

There are 2 syntaxes:
`hasMany` keyword 
`belongsTo` keyword 

If you have a custom name of Identifier (ID/Primary Key) or Foreign Key(FK) columns, You may also override the foreign and local keys by passing additional arguments to the belongsTo.

As an example below, the `kota`, `penjual` table, and `id_kota` column isn‚Äôt a standard name of Laravel Eloquent Model. We should define it in the following way(use overriding if necessary).

Inside the Penjual Class

Class Penjual extends Model {
   protected $table = ‚Äòpenjual‚Äô;
 
   public function kota() {
     return $this->belongsTo(Kota::class, ‚Äòid_kota‚Äô);
   }

}
Pay attention to the position of the columns (red and green), don't get them mixed up !

One to Many : belongsTo (2)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
The usage of Eloquent‚Äôs `belongsTo` statement is the same as the picture above.
This syntax can implement inside the Controller.
Define or import ModelClass first
$comment has a Post object that has id=1
You can get the title of post based on number #3, you can type with this format: 
$comment->your_function>your_field_of_object

Example : `belongsTo` keyword 

Eloquent Relationship : Many to Many
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
This example is the many-to-many scenario with the standard name of Laravel Eloquent Model

Criteria:
Each tables use plural nouns.
Intermediated table use singular noun of each many-to-many and order with alphabetic

Many to Many : hasMany
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
There are 1 syntaxes: `belongsToMany` keyword 

If you have a custom name of Identifier (ID/Primary key) and Foreign_key, You may also override the foreign and local keys by passing additional arguments to the belongsToMany.

As an example, the `user`, `role`, `UserRole` table, and `UserId`, `RoleId`  column isn‚Äôt a standard name of Laravel Eloquent Model. You must define with
Class User extends Model {
   protected $table = ‚ÄòUser‚Äô;
 
   public function roles() {
     return $this->belongsToMany(Role::class, 
                 ‚ÄòUserRole‚Äô,
                 `UserId`,`RoleId`);
   }
}
Class Role extends Model {
   protected $table = ‚ÄòRole‚Äô;
 
   public function users() {
     return $this->belongsToMany(User::class, 
                 ‚ÄòUserRole‚Äô,
                 `RoleId`,`UserId`);
   }
}

Many to Many : Get Value
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
In this example, we want to get the data creation time of role_user data.

So, we must get value of `created_at` from specific role
You can use ->pivot->

Example
Retrieving creation time data from role_user table for user with user_id=1 and role_id=2

#1 PracticeOur Case Study
31
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Assign your Food with Category
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Based on our case study, we know that Food as one category but one category can have multiple variant of food.

So the Data Design shown as follow:
CategoriesID (PK)
Name
. . . .
FoodID (PK)
Name of Food
‚Ä¶..
category_id (FK)

One To Many : belongsTo
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Discussion in your class: 
Can you explain why this example uses `belongsTo` and why does the example decide to give ‚Äòcategory‚Äô as function name?

One To Many : hasMany
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Discussion in your class: 
Can you explain why this example uses `hasMany` and use ‚Äúfoods‚Äù in function name?

Try your current project ‚Üí List of Food
Change your id_category with name category with Eloquent Model

Your ‚ÄúFood.index‚Äù view, add one column and modify your ‚Äúcategory_id‚Äù based on Your Model

Try your current project ‚Üí List of Category
Add new Column for Number of Foods and List name of Foods


Show specific Food : Try it !
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Please open your FoodController !

If you don‚Äôt have Food Controller, you can run this command: 
php artisan make:controller FoodController --resource

show() function inside your Controller is used to inform the details of your object (in this case is Product object)

show() function always required 1 parameter ($id) that represented the value of ID product. 

With php artisan route:list you can see the required parameter routing and the route name below.

Insert dd function to inspect the specific food data
Use route list to know the URL format
Debugging 
using dd(dump and die)
DD will ‚Äòdump‚Äô your query result and make the apps temporarily ‚Äòdie‚Äô.

There is no data inside attributes

Remove Model inside parameter function


Debugging using dd(dump and die)
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
We can see the `Magic` statement
$data  is the variable sent from controller 

->places  is function of Eloquent Relationship in the Places Model.
->name  is an attributed based on our database


Example : http://127.0.0.1:8000/tickets/show/1

Show Implementation
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Don‚Äôt forget to create blade file in resource/view/product directory, name it show.blade.php


Ensure the route (show) passes with id parameter

Construction View
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Use Boostrap View Template. For catalog or list of data, you can use this example:  
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_cards.asp  
https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/components/cards/ 
https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/extended/gallery/ 
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/ 

For the detail page, we recommend use this:  
https://bootstrapexamples.com/@andreas-muller/product-details-page 

Go to example of Boostrap (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_card&stacked=h)
Construct HTML, Import CSS/JS from Boostrap
Use Basic Card first based on the example







Run project first


Change the body with another example (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/ ) 
 



Make link from your list to your detail data food

Reports
50
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Reports in an Information System
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Reports in an information system are the result of analysis of data in the database.

Data analysis can use previous query concepts such as
Data Aggregation
Join Data
Sort data
Filter data

Laravel gives you the freedom to create custom reporting on URLs.

Create Custom URL
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Please re-open our Routing Material (from Week 1 or Week 2) https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/routing#basic-routing

Form Report usually uses the GET HTTP method because the report function predominately retrieves data from the database and displays it in the view. So Routing (in routes/web.php) which we will often use has a syntax format

#2 Practice

Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya

Practice #2
Informatics Engineering | Universitas Surabaya
Please create a new page for showing category list with total foods.

Hint :
Add custom URL in web.php (url : BASE_URL/category/showTotalFoods
Create function in CategoryController
In query, use count() to get total category 
If there is no food in specific category, system will set total food = 0
Create view with name totalfood.blade.php inside category folder
